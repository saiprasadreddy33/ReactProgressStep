 View Component in StoryBook:

    ProgressSteps Component:
        This component is responsible for rendering a progress indicator with multiple steps.
        It receives props such as activeStep and layout to control the current active step and the layout orientation of the progress indicator.
        The component contains logic to handle navigation between steps and to dynamically adjust the width of the progress indicator based on the active step.
        It utilizes styled-components for styling, allowing for dynamic styling based on the layout orientation.

    RegistrationScreen Component:
        This component represents a screen where users can register by providing their information.
        It includes an instance of the ProgressSteps component to visually represent the progress of the registration process.
        Additionally, it contains input fields for the user to input their username, phone number, and email.

    ProgressStepsStory Component:
        This component contains stories for the ProgressSteps component.
        It demonstrates different configurations and variations of the ProgressSteps component, such as different layouts (horizontal, vertical, cell) and active steps.
        Each story provides a visual representation of the ProgressSteps component with different props configurations, allowing developers to preview and test the component's behavior in Storybook.

Overall, these components work together to create a user-friendly registration process with a visually appealing progress indicator. Developers can easily customize and test the ProgressSteps component using Storybook, ensuring a smooth and intuitive registration experience for users.
